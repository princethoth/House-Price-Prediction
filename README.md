# House Price Prediction

## 🏡 Project Overview

This project applies **advanced regression techniques** to predict house prices based on key property attributes. It explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to improve prediction accuracy for real estate valuation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand housing market trends.
* Engineer features to enhance model performance.
* Compare multiple regression models, including Ridge, Lasso, and Gradient Boosting.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R².

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **scikit-learn**, **xgboost**
